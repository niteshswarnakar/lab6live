                    with parchment paper with a 2" overhang. Press cookie dough
                    into bottom of baking dish. Top with a single layer of
                    Oreos, breaking them up to fit, if necessary, and set aside.
                    Make cheesecake layer: In a medium bowl using a handheld
                    mixer or stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat cream

                    completely chilled, at least 3 hours and up to overnight.

                    Make the pie crust according to this pie crust recipe. You
                    can also use store bought pie crust.While pie crust is
                    resting in the fridge, toss the sliced apples with the lemon
                    juice, brown sugar, cinnamon and flour. Set aside.Remove the
                    dough from the refrigerator, and let it sit at room
                    temperature for up to 10 minutes. This is required to soften
                    the dough a bit, so that you can roll it out.Preheat oven to
                    375 F degrees. Roll out each disc using a rolling pin. If
                    your dough is sticking to the surface or to the rolling pin
                    add a bit more flour as necessary. Roll it until it’s about
                    1/8 of an inch in thickness. Place the pie dough lightly
                    into a pie plate. I usually roll it on the rolling pin and
                    unroll it over the pie plate. (see video) Crimp the edge and
                    cut off excess dough.Add the apple mixture to the bottom
                    crust.Roll out the second disc. Gently place on top of the
                    filling and make vents using a sharp knife, or cut into long
                    strips to make a lattice. Trim the excess dough, if needed.
                    Brush generously with beaten egg.Bake for about an hour or
                    until the crust is golden and starts to brown and juices are
                    bubbling

                  <p class="second">
                    Preheat the oven to 350 F degrees. Prepare the baking pans:
                    Prepare 2 8 inch cake pans. Cut out 2 parchment paper
                    circles that will fit inside each pan and spray them with
                    some cooking spray. Make sure to spray some cooking spray up
                    the sides of the pans too.Make the cake batter: In the bowl
                    of your mixer, add the flour, sugar, cocoa powder, salt,
                    baking powder, baking soda and using the paddle attachment
                    mix everything together until well combined, on low speed.
                    In a large bowl mix together the buttermilk, coconut oil,
                    eggs, and vanilla extract. Whisk in the coffee and food
                    coloring. Add the wet ingredients to the mixer bowl and mix
                    everything over medium speed for about 2 minutes, until
                    everything is well combined. Scrape the bottom of the bowl
                    with a spatula and mix as needed. Add more red food coloring
                    as needed to get to the desired color. Pour the batter into
                    the 2 prepared pans, equally. Bake: Place the cake pans in
                    the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. To test if the cake
                    is done, insert a toothpick in the middle of the cake and if
                    it comes out clean, it’s done. Let the cake cool in the pans
                    for about 30 minutes, then turn them out onto a cooling rack
                    or a cutting board and cool completely.Prepare the cream
                    cheese frosting: In the bowl of your mixer whip the whipping
                    cream until soft peaks form. Remove from mixer bowl and
                    refrigerate until ready to use.In the bowl of your mixer,
                    beat the cream cheese together with the vanilla extract and
                    icing sugar, until smooth. Fold in the whipping cream
                    gradually until well combined. Assemble the cake: Cut the
                    top part of the cake first and crumbled it up in a bowl,
                    we’ll use this for decoration after.Cut each cake into 2
                    pieces. Start by placing 1 cake layer onto your serving cake
                    platter, then spread some of the cream cheese frosting,
                    about 1/4, evenly over the cake layer. Repeat with remaining
                    cake layers. Using a spatula, spread the cream cheese
                    frosting evenly over the top of the cake and up the sides.
                    Decorate the cake with the remaining cake crumbs if desired.
                    Refrigerate until ready to serve.

                    Preheat oven to 350 F and line a 13x9 baking pan with
                    parchment paper. Be sure that parchment hangs over the
                    edges, you will use it to lift out the bars when they are
                    cool. Make the Crust In bowl of your food processor, pulse
                    to combine flour, powdered sugar and butter. Process until
                    coarse crumbs are formed, just as the dough begins to come
                    together. Dump crumb mixture into prepared pan and press
                    evenly. Bake for 18-20 minutes, until lightly browned.
                    Remove from oven and allow to cool on wire rack. Make the
                    Lemon Filling With an electric mixer set at medium speed,
                    beat granulated sugar, flour, eggs, lemon juice, and lemon
                    zest until ingredients are well blended. Pour mixture evenly

                  <p class="second">
                    Preheat the oven to 350F. Line 2 half sheet pans with
                    parchment paper or silpat liners. Whisk together the butter,
                    granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a large bowl. Whisk in
                    the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract until smooth. Add the
                    flour, oats, cinnamon, nutmeg, baking soda, salt, and
                    ginger, and stir to combine. Stir in the grated carrot,
                    shredded coconut, and raisins. Use a 1 1/2 tablespoon sized
                    scoop to scoop the dough and roll it into balls. Arrange
                    them 2 inches apart on the prepared baking trays so they
                    have room to expand (8 cookies per half sheet pan works
                    well). Bake the cookies 2 trays at a time until they’re
                    golden along the outside and still look just a touch doughy
                    in the center, about 14 to 15 minutes, rotating the trays
                    once halfway through. (If baking 1 tray at a time, start
                    checking for doneness at 11 minutes.) Cook the remaining
                    cookie dough the same way. Let the cookies cool on the trays
                    before removing.
