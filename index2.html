                    Melt butter in skillet over medium heat. Sauté red bell
                    pepper, shallots, and garlic until soft. Set aside. In a

                    patties. If you feel that your patties are not solid enough,
                    you can sparingly add a little more breadcrumbs to get them
                    where you want them to be. Heat olive oil in skillet over
                    medium-high heat until shimmering. Cook patties on both
                    sides until browned, about 2-3 minutes per side. Drain
                    patties on paper towels. Serve with tartar sauce.

                    Rub salt and pepper into the meat.
                    Mix the other ingredients in a  dish, add the pork and turn to coat.
                    Place a lid on the dish.
                    Turn and baste the meat 3 or 4 times during its marination period. Marinate for a minimum of 2 hours, 6-12 hours is even better.
                    Before cooking, scrape off the marinade and dry the meat thoroughly with paper towels. Marinated meat needs to be dried off before cooking or it will not brown properly.
                    Preheat grill to medium high heat.
                    Wad up a piece of paper towel, add some canola oil to the towel. Using a pair of tongs, rub the oiled paper towel on the grill grates.
                    Cook pork chops undisturbed for 4 minutes per side.
                    Turn heat down to medium-low, move pork to an area of the grill without flame. Close lid and continue cooking until internal temperature reaches 145 F, about 5-10 minutes depending on the thickness of your chops.
                    Remove from grill to a cutting board. Cover chops with foil to keep warm and allow them to rest for 5 minutes. Slice and serve.

Reduce the heat to medium-high; cook for 5 minutes per side or until lightly browned and thoroughly cooked. Transfer to a plate and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cover to keep warm.
                    While the chicken is cooking, whisk together the vinaigrette ingredients in a small bowl.
                    Rinse the spinach in cool water. (I skipped the next section for wilting as I used romaine instead) Transfer to a Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Cover and cook without additional water, except for the drops that cling to the leaves, for 2 minutes or until slightly wilted. Uncover and remove the pan from the heat.
                    Slice the chicken into 1/2 inch diagonal strips.
                    To assemble the salads, spread steamed spinach on each plate. Top with the chicken strips, corn, and chevre cheese.
                    Stir the vinaigrette and drizzle it over the salads.
